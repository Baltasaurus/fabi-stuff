# Familysearch scraper

This script scrapesfrom Familysearch.com for records and saves them to an excel file. The heavy lifting is done with Selenium-which automates a browser-and BeautifulSoup-to parse the HTML. I wrote this to help my friend who was researching demographic changes in early 20th century Chile.
